# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
## ðŸ§  Overview

This project monitors the driverâ€™s eye movements using a webcam. If the driver appears drowsy (based on eye aspect ratio or a trained CNN model), it triggers an alarm and optionally sends an SMS alert.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Real-time facial landmark detection using `dlib`
- Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) based drowsiness detection
- Alarm alert using `pygame`
- Web interface using Flask to stream live video
- Optional:
  - SMS alerts using Twilio API
  - Deep learning-based drowsiness detection using a custom CNN
- Portable and ready for integration in vehicle systems

## ðŸŽ¯ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- dlib
- Flask
- Pygame (for alarm)
- Twilio (for mobile alerts)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN model)
